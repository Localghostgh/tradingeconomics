This is a web application built with Python using the Flask framework that visualizes trade data of two countries - Mexico and Thailand.

To use this project, you'll need to install the following libraries:

Flask
pandas
tradingeconomics
plotly

You can install them via pip by running the following command in your terminal:
'pip install Flask pandas tradingeconomics plotly'

To run the application, simply navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:
'python app.py'

This will start the application on your local server, which you can access by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:5000/.

Once you have the application up and running, you'll be able to view a line chart that displays the balance of trade data for Mexico and Thailand over a period of one year (January 2022 - December 2022). You can also view the raw data in two HTML tables below the chart.
